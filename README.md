# Melanoma Detection
To build a CNN based model which can accurately detect melanoma. Melanoma is a type of cancer that can be deadly if not detected early. It accounts for 75% of skin cancer deaths. A solution that can evaluate images and alert dermatologists about the presence of melanoma has the potential to reduce a lot of manual effort needed in diagnosis.

## General Information
The dataset consists of 2357 images of malignant and benign oncological diseases, which were formed from the International Skin Imaging Collaboration (ISIC). All images were sorted according to the classification taken with ISIC, and all subsets were divided into the same number of images, with the exception of melanomas and moles, whose images are slightly dominant.

The data set contains the following diseases:
Actinic keratosis
Basal cell carcinoma
Dermatofibroma
Melanoma
Nevus
Pigmented benign keratosis
Seborrheic keratosis
Squamous cell carcinoma
Vascular lesion

## Conclusions
- When we build a model on the provided dataset, the training accuracy is increasing linearly over time, whereas validation accuracy stalls around 55% in the training process. Also, the difference in accuracy between training and validation accuracy is noticeable â€” a sign of overfitting.
Validation loss also goes up after certain reduce which indicates Overfitting.
- After Data Augmentation the Training and Validation Accuracy matches but still the model can do better.
- It was observed that the dataset has class imbalance. To correct it, the data was augmented by adding 500 samples to each class and balance. Post that when we build the model, it solved overfitting problem and Validation accuracy improved to 85% and Testing accuracy 90%.
